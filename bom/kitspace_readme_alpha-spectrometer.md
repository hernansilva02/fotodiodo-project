# DIY Particle Detector
## Alpha-Spectrometer Variant

This open hardware project is a mobile low-cost spectrometer for measuring ionising radiation like alpha particles and electrons (energy range: 33 keV to 8 MeV).
It's an educational tool and citizen science device made for exploring natural and synthetic sources of radioactivity such as stones, airborne radon, potassium-rich salt or food and every-day objects (Uranium glass, old Radium watches etc.).

The other [electron-detector variant](https://kitspace.org/boards/github.com/ozel/diy_particle_detector/diy%20electron%20detector/) of this project is easier to operate but cannot measure alpha particles.
Both versions of the DIY Particle Detector are using the same circuit board with different sets of components.
